        Hiphop Tamizha (pronounced [t̪amiɻaː]) is an Indian musical duo based in
        Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The duo consists of Adhithya "Adhi" Venkatapathy
        and R. Jeeva.[a] Their commercial break-through came with the song "Club
        le Mabbu le" in 2011. In 2012, Hiphop Tamizha released their debut album
        Hip Hop Tamizhan, which is India's first Tamil hip hop album. It was a
        major success with both the general public and critics. While the duo
        were originally independent musicians, since 2013 they have contributed
        primarily to composing for films.

      <h2>Personal Lives:</h2>
      <p class="para1">
        Adhithya "Adhi" Ramachandran Venkatapathy was born on 20 February
        1990,[2][6][non-primary source needed] and R. Jeeva was born 29 June
        1991. Adhi's father works at Bharathiar University while his mother
        comes from an agricultural background.[3] Adhi's first exposure to rap
        came when his neighbour showed him Michael Jackson's "Jam".[7] His
        interest in hip hop music started developing in the tenth grade. He
        uploaded rap songs to the internet and got positive responses from
        people expressing interest in his music, who also encouraged him to
        start rapping in Tamil.[8] His decision to rap in Tamil rather than
        English was made, in his words, to avoid looking like a "wannabe".[7]
        Adhi named his account on the video-sharing site in YouTube as "Hiphop
        Tamizha", with a profile picture of the Tamil poet Subramania Bharati,
        to avoid being caught by his parents.[9] Adhi's father had initially
        opposed his choice to pursue music professionally.[10] He wanted Adhi to
        pursue higher studies, but gave him a year to do what he wanted, with
        the only constraint being that Adhi should not expect any help from him.
        After realising that Adhi was "trying to do some good work", he
        encouraged his son's musical interests.[9] Adhi then moved to Chennai to
        "try [his] luck".[11] Although Hiphop is a duo,[5][12] Jeeva has seldom
        made public appearances, thus associating the name Hiphop Tamizha with
        Adhi more often. Adhi told IndiaGlitz that this is due to his shyness,
        and compared his partner to the unseen lion in the emblem of India,
        which includes four lions, with only three visible.[13] Jeeva adopted
        the moniker Jeeva Beatz sometime after the two met in 2005.[1][9] Adhi
        studied at Chavara Vidya Bhavan and Electrical Engineering at Bannari
        Amman Institute of Technology. He holds a state-level rank in Tamil Nadu
        Common Entrance Test and is a graduate in Master of Business
        Administration from the Department of Management Studies, University of
        Madras. As of October 2014, he was doing a PhD course at Bharathiar
        University,[9] which he completed in June 2015.[14] Jeeva is an alumnus
        of Loyola College, Chennai.[15] On 30 November 2017, Adhi married
        Latchaya Devareddy, in a private ceremony at Tirupati.[16][17]

      <h2><b>Commercial and Success</b></h2>
      <p class="para1">
        Adhi composed the song "Club le Mabbu le" in his first year of
        college.[18] When we asked how it developed, he recalled, "I grew up
        watching my mother and aunts just being traditional, and when I saw
        girls going to bars, I immediately wrote the lyrics of that track. And
        through my lyrics I am raising the debate over whether we are really
        changing as a society or are simply aping the West."[22] When Adhi was
        living in Chennai, he met Ma Ka Pa Anand, then an RJ at Radio
        Mirchi.[11] Anand allowed Adhi to perform Club le Mabbule on his radio
        show with beatboxer Bharadwaj Balaji (also known as Triple B).[9][23]
        The recording went viral, receiving over two million views within a week
        of its release on YouTube. Afterwards Rémy Martin, an international
        brand, was surprised by Adhi's determination and launched Hiphop Tamizha
        as an official brand.[9] "Club le Mabbule" later vaulted Hiphop Tamizha
        further into public view when it was criticised as portraying Tamil
        women in a negative light.[24] Hiphop Tamizha's debut album Hip Hop
        Tamizhan was released on 17 August 2012 at Sathyam Cinemas in Chennai.
        Publicised as "India's first Tamil hip hop album", it was launched by
        Purple Note and produced by Remy Martin, in the latter's first
        association with an Indian album. The music was composed by Adhi and
        Jeeva, with lyrics by Adhi.[19] The album was lauded by critics. Naren
        Weiss, writing for Zomba, called it "nothing short of a masterpiece",
        while Venkatrangan R of Musicperk labelled it "A must listen. Not only
        for the music but for the messages hidden in it."[19][non-primary source
        needed] The album, which included Club le Mabbule, was also a commercial
        success, becoming the best-selling music album of 2012 on Flipkart.[25]
        However, Adhi lamented the fact that "Club le Mabbule" was accepted for
        airplay by radio channels only after its viral success, and that some of
        his other songs never got airplay even once.[26] In November 2013, Adhi
        signed an international album with Remy Martin, titled International
        Tamizhan, slated to feature eight tracks, including two songs by
        American artists Sol and Emcee Call. The album was to be released in
        English, Hindi and Tamil. It was initially scheduled for release on 15
        August 2014;[20][27][28] however, Hiphop Tamizha instead released the
        album's song "Vaadi Pulla Vaadi" as a single on the same date.[29][30]
        In October 2014, Adhi said the album was still "under progress",[9] but
        confirmed in 2018 that it was altogether dropped because "independent
        music doesn't make big money" in Chennai.[31] In August 2020, Adhi
        announced a new album titled Naa Oru Alien.[32]
